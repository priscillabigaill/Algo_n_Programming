    "#1 Write a function called convert to days() that takes no parameters. Have your function prompt the user to input numbers of hours, minutes, and seconds. Write a helper function called get days() that uses these values and converts them to days in float form (fractions of a day are allowed). get days() should return the number of days. Use this helper function within the convert to days() function to display the numbers of days to the user. The built-in function round() takes two arguments: a number and an integer indicating the desired precision (i.e., the desired number of digits beyond the decimal point). Use this function to round the number of days four digits after the decimal point.\n",

    "#2 Write a function called calc weight on planet() that calculates your equivalent weight on another planet. This function takes two arguments: your weight on Earth in pounds and the surface gravity of the planet of interest with units m/s2. Make the second argument optional and supply a default value of 23.1 m/s2 which is the approximate surface gravity of Jupiter (Earth’s suface gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s2). To perform the conversion, use the equation: weight is equal to mass times suface gravity. Since your weight on Earth is given and you know the Earth’s surface gravity, have your function use this information to calculate your mass (it is fine if, at this point, the units of mass are a mix of Imperial and the MKS system). Then, use your mass and the given surface gravity to calculate your effective weight on the other planet.\n",

    "#4 The aspect ratio of an image describes the relationship between the width and height. Aspect ratios are usually expressed as two numbers separated by a colon that represent width and height respectively. Common aspect ratios in photography are 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9. An image that has an aspect ratio of x : y means that for every x inches of width you will have y inches of height no matter the size of the image (and, of course, you can use any unit of length, not just inches, and even abstract units such as pixels). Suppose you are writing a blog and you have an image that is m units wide and n units high but your blog only has space for an image that is z units wide (where z is less than m). Write a function called calc new height() that returns the height the image must be in order to preserve the aspect ratio (i.e., a height that will not distort the image). This function takes no arguments and prompts the user for the current width, the current height, and the desired new width. In addition to returning the new height, this function also prints the value. The new height is a float regardless of the types of the values the user entered.\n",
